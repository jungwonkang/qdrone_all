# MATLAB simulation of UAV localization using UWB and IMU

This repository includes MATLAB codes used for CSRS 2018. 
  - The codes are for (1) UWB and IMU simulator and (2) the implementation of GTSAM for UAV localization using UWB and IMU.
  - The [following link](https://github.com/yorku-ausml/qdrone/blob/master/doc/CSRS_20180619/csrs2018_pptx_final.pdf) shows the presentation file in CSRS 2018.
  - The codes were tested on MATLAB R2013a.
  
To run the programs, please see *doc/howto_run.txt*.
